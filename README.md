# Welcome to Degen DKG Gaming Solidity Contract!

Hello there, welcome to my project! For this project, I have written a smart contract that implements the mint(), balanceOf(), transfer(), and all other functions of the ERC20 token standard.


## Description 

The contract is an implementation of the ERC20 token standard, with additional features such as minting and burning of tokens. The contract is designed to be owned by a single entity, who has the exclusive right to mint new tokens. This project was created for Degen Gaming 🎮, a renowned game studio, to create a unique token that can reward players and take their game to the next level.



#### Creating Tokens 
Users can create their own tokens - it's as simple as calling the mint() function.

#### Burning 

Any user can burn their tokens, reducing the total supply. Burn it if you can handle the heat! 🔥


#### Checking Balances
This balanceof() will help you with knowing you balance


#### Transferring Tokens

You can send/donate tokens to any address with the transfer() function.

#### Ownership

The contract is owned by the entity that deploys it. Only the owner can mint new tokens.

easy-to-use...
